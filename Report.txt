INTERPRETATION AND BUSINESS INSIGHT

1. My Approach

The dataset used in this project was obtained from a wine production company and contains various physicochemical properties of wine samples, along with their corresponding quality ratings. The dataset was provided in a compressed file, which I unzipped and loaded into my Jupyter Notebook environment using the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.

Data Loading and Preliminary Analysis

After successfully reading the dataset, I began with preliminary data exploration to understand its structure and contents. I displayed the first six rows of the dataset using the head() function to inspect the features and verify that the data was properly loaded. This step provided an overview of the numerical attributes, such as acidity, sugar content, pH, sulphates, alcohol percentage, and the target variable, quality.


Data Cleaning

To ensure data integrity, I checked for missing values using the isnull().sum() function. The output revealed that there were no missing values in any of the columns, confirming that the dataset was complete.

Next, I checked for duplicate entries using the duplicated() function and discovered 937 duplicate rows. Since duplicate records can bias model training and distort analysis results, I decided to remove them using the drop_duplicates() function. After dropping the duplicates, I rechecked the dataset to confirm that all redundant rows had been successfully removed, ensuring a clean and consistent dataset.

Following that, I verified the data types of each column to confirm they were correctly formatted for analysis. I corrected any inconsistencies for instance, ensuring all numerical columns were in the correct float or integer format where necessary.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

After data cleaning, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain deeper insights into the dataset. I defined a Python function to automate univariate analysis for all numerical features. This involved plotting histograms to visualize the distribution of each variable and identify possible skewness or outliers.

Additionally, I examined the pairwise correlation between each feature and the target variable (quality) to determine which attributes most strongly influence wine quality. I used the corr() function to compute the correlation coefficients, and then visualized the relationships using a bar plot and a heatmap for better interpretation.

From this analysis, I was able to identify the most significant predictors of wine quality, such as alcohol content, volatile acidity, and sulphates. These insights helped in selecting relevant features for subsequent modeling.


Data Scaling

Finally, I applied data scaling to standardize the range of all numerical features. Since most machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the scale of data, scaling ensures that features with large numerical ranges do not dominate those with smaller ranges. I employed StandardScaler from the scikit-learn library to transform the features into a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).

This completed the preprocessing stage, ensuring that the dataset was clean, consistent, and properly scaled for modeling and optimization in subsequent stages of the project.

 
 
 2. Model Performance Metrics
To evaluate the performance of the model, several metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score were analyzed. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of how well the model distinguishes between different wine quality categories  specifically, whether a wine is classified as good or bad based on its physicochemical properties.
Based on the model’s evaluation metrics, it was observed that the precision for good wine was relatively higher than that of bad wine. This indicates that the model is more confident and accurate when predicting good-quality wines, meaning that when it classifies a wine as good, it is more likely to be correct.
The model’s evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  were used to assess its ability to classify wine quality as either good or bad.
The results show that the model achieved higher precision for good wine, meaning it is more accurate when predicting wines as good. This indicates strong confidence in identifying high-quality wines correctly. However, the precision for bad wine was slightly lower, suggesting occasional misclassifications of good wines as bad.
Overall, the model performs better for good-quality wines, while showing room for improvement in detecting bad wines. The balanced F1-score demonstrates that the model generalizes fairly well but could benefit from further optimization, such as rebalancing the dataset or fine-tuning hyperparameters.

3. Highlight which features most influence wine quality(based on model feature importance or coefficients)
The analysis revealed that alcohol content, volatile acidity, and sulphates are the most influential features affecting wine quality. Higher alcohol levels and sulphate concentrations generally correlate with better-quality wines, while higher volatile acidity tends to reduce wine quality. Other features such as citric acid, density, and residual sugar also show moderate influence but to a lesser extent.
